CGI-AutoForm version 1.04
=========================

There are many CGI form abstractions available, (e.g. CGI.pm).  A unique and
powerful advantage with this abstraction is that it can be tied closely with a
database schema. Each group of fields in the form can represent a database
table (or view) and the table/column properties and constraints are
automagically discovered so your DBA can make DDL changes that will be
immediately reflected in the HTML forms (no duplication of the data dictionary
in your code).

All user/operator input is checked tightly against database constraints and
there is built-in magic to provide convenient select lists, etc, and to enforce
a discreet set of valid values against unique/primary keys in lookup tables.
This means referential integrity even for MySQL. Metadata in MySQL's SET and
ENUM types are also supported.  This also gives the operator a chance to
correct mistakes with helpful hints instead of just getting a meaningless db
error code.

This design allows you to get secure, database-driven web apps up and running is as little as a few
hours. See Cruddy! for an implementation

Another advantage this abstraction provides is the separation of presentation
and style using style sheets and having human-friendly presentation This is
made possible with the help of the DBIx::IO abstraction, please refer to it for
further details.  attributes stored in a database table that can be managed by
non-engineers.
